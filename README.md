# Intelligent Resume Screening and Analysis System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Intelligent Resume Screening and Analysis System** revolutionizes recruitment by automating and enhancing the initial stages of resume screening.
It tackles the challenges of high application volume and human error through a **hybrid AI approach**, combining:

* **Traditional Machine Learning (ML)** for classification
* **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for nuanced data extraction

This provides recruiters with **rapid, consistent, and insightful candidate summaries**.

### ✨ Key Advantages

* **Speed**: Rapid processing of high-volume applications
* **Consistency**: Standardized evaluation reduces human bias
* **Insights**: Deeper analysis beyond simple keyword matching
